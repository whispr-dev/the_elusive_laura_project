2408252250


a while back i saw LoRA gateway cards being sold and realsied they had so few in stoock that i'd be wise to grab one now ecven if i didnt actually engage in the projec t immediately.

welp, it's been over 9months and i stillhavent started so apparently _that_ was a ad idea psychologically. :| oop.


- it's just a collection of the documents and geenral random crap i collected so far, parlty because a bunch of it was very vaourlike forum posts n stuff that i didnt want to vanishfrom the public record unsaved and loved until i had a chance to do a full writeeup on the topic an document my project.

as it is this whole thing is classified under "VICTIM OF PROCRASTINATION". to be continued...
